==>Array is a kind of data structure that stores many variables(elements) as a single special variable.each of varibles
in an array is called an array element and they have the same variable type. We could have an array of integers or an
array of characters or an array of anything else that has a defined data type. In addition, array starts from zero(th) position up forward.
*******************************************************************************************************************************************
==>we can declare an array by choosing :
	- datatype of element in the array   int score[4343]
	- number of elements in the array
Ex: creating an array:
	int num[20];
	float score[10];
	char name[50];
	char subjects[5][100]; 5 is numbers of elements and each of element can store 100 character.

==>Array is different between each other with index or position.
==>Array has two types:
  - one dimensional array
  - two dimensional array
